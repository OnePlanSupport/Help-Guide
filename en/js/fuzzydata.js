"body" : "Let’s begin by breaking down the statement “Sofia GPT is an advanced Azure OpenAI GPT module developed by OnePlan.” Azure  is a cloud computing platform operated by Microsoft that provides access, management, and development of applications and services via globally distributed data centers. OpenAI  is an AI research group responsible for the creation of the popular AI models GPT (language-based generative AI), and DALL-E (image-based generative AI). GPT is short for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer.” “Generative” means that the AI model can create new data based on patterns that it has learned from its training data. “Pre-trained” means that the model has already been optimized based on this source data, meaning that it does not need to check back against its original training data every time it is prompted. So, it is a lot faster and more powerful than older AI models. And “Transformer” is a powerful type of neural network algorithm specialized in learning relationships between long strings of data, like sentences and paragraphs. In simpler terms, the GPT models are very good pattern identifiers and replicators. The GPT model AIs have been trained on huge quantities of human language. The AIs then learn common patterns between words in those datasets, and in doing so, become very good at reproducing human language. So, OnePlan developed Sofia GPT as a customized chatbot app that utilizes OpenAI’s GPT AI model. All of this is then hosted in Azure (Microsoft) data centers and integrates seamlessly with OnePlan technology. The Sofia GPT module is particularly useful for OnePlan users because it can leverage data not only from OpenAI’s network of data sources but from OnePlan itself. This makes Sofia GPT much different from other AI helpers found in PPM tools. Typically, the AI helpers are not able to access the data in the PPM tool, and so the analysis the AI is able to provide is limited to external data sources. Sofia GPT, however, can analyze data right from your OnePlan environment and provide a customized analysis that is relevant to you, your team, and your business. " },
