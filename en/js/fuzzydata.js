"body" : "Let's begin by taking a look at an example Portfolio Board. The board view is customizable, so it can be helpful to see an example of how the board can be configured. In this example, each column on the board represents a Business Unit (IT, Product Development, and Marketing in this example). At the top of each column, you can see the total budget of all of the items within each column. So, for example, here you can see the total Budget (see the Totals setting in the header) of all of the items in the IT column equals $3,919,245. Each card in the columns represents a project or epic in your portfolio. The cards are color-coded by the project or epic Status (out of the box, green = On Track, yellow = At Risk, red = Off Track). The cards also display some general information about the project or epic, including the Benefits , Budget , Business Unit , and Prioritization Score . At the bottom of each card, you can see a bar displaying the project or epic overall % Done , how many days the project has been in a particular stage, and a color-coded dot representing the project or epic State (out of the box, light gray = Proposed, blue = Active, yellow = On Hold, dark gray = Closed). There is also a speech bubble icon you can click to add comments for a project or epic. The lines connecting different cards on the board represent dependencies between various projects or epics. The direction of the arrow shows the direction of the successor\/predecessor relationship, with the arrow pointing at the predecessor. The color of the line represents the method of the relationship, with blue lines representing regular dependent relationships, and red lines representing blocker relationships. All of these settings are configurable so you can personalize the Portfolio Board in a way that works best for you. " },

"body" : "Now that we have walked through an example of a Portfolio Board configuration, let's dive into how you can configure the board for your use. All of the board configuration settings are available here in the board header. New Plan : Click to create a new plan in your Portfolio. If you create a new plan from the board view, it may not display on the board immediately, as the new plan will likely not fit into the board view configuration. If you would like to view the new plan on the board, you need to go to the Portfolio List view, locate the new plan, and update the plan information so it fits into the columns and lanes of the board. Column : Select the plan field want to use for the columns in the board. For example, I will click on the Column menu, and select Goals from the drop-down. Now the Goals plan field will be used for the columns in the board. Lanes : Select the plan field want to use for the lanes in the board. For example, I will click on the Lanes menu, and select Program from the drop-down. Now the board will have swim lanes to group the cards by the Program they belong to. Color By : Select the plan field want to use to color-code the cards on the board. For example, I will click on the Color By menu, and select Process Step . Now the cards on the board will be color-coded by the project or epic's current process step. Totals : Select the plan field want to use as the column totals. For example, I will click on the Totals menu, and select Benefits from the drop-down. Now the column total value is a sum of the Benefits values of all of the projects and epics in the column. Plan Type : Select the plan types you would like available on the board as cards. For example, I will click on the Plan Types menu, and in the drop-down, you can see that I could display Portfolios , Programs , Projects , and Epics . These are the different plan types that are available in the My Portfolio area currently. Here I will select Projects and Epics . This means that all of the cards on the board represent a project or epic from my portfolio of work. Filter : Use the filters interface to select plan fields to use as filters to limit the number of items that appear in the board. For example, I might set a filter on the Status field, and only load in projects and epics with a Status of On Track . In the screenshot below, you can see the board with the Status > On Track filter applied. Notice that the Filter icon is highlighted blue. This means that there is a filter applied. To remove the filters, simply click on the Filter icon, then select Clear Filters (the first option in the Filter drop-down). This will remove all filters. Zoom : Select the size of the cards on the board. Options here include Small , Medium , and Large . Large is the default size. Small cards look like this: Medium cards look like this: Large cards look like this: Constraints : Set the constraint values for the columns in the board to run some light what-if scenarios. The constraints are based on the value you selected for the Totals . So, in the example I've been using throughout this article, the Totals , and thus the Constraints , are based on the Benefits values of the projects and epics in the board. To set constraints in the board: Click on the Constraints icon, the Edit [Selected Totals] Constraints form will open. Select the Constraint Goal. Options include None , Above Constraint , or Below Constraint . Because in this example I am working with Benefits as my Total values, I want to be above the constraint value I will set, as more benefits from projects and epics = more money for the organization. So, I will select Above Constraint . Set the constraint values for each column. Again, I am working with Benefits in this example. So for each column, I want to set the minimum benefits I want to see from all of the projects and epics in a column. To set these constraint values, click into the Constraint field for each column, and enter the desired value. Once the constraints are all set, click Save . Now, when you hover over the column title, you can view the column Total value compared to the column Constraint value to see if you are hitting your goals. Fields : Select the plan fields you would like displayed on the cards on the board. Out of the box, the Benefits, Budget, Business Unit, and Prioritization Score fields are displayed on the cards. For this example, I will also add the Funding Available and Overall Health fields to the cards. To do this, click on the Fields icon, then select the desired fields (Funding Available and Overall Health ) from the drop-down. The data from the selected fields will now be displayed on the cards on the board. " },

"body" : "[video] This article explains resource cost types used in the OnePlan Resource Planner. Select the Cost Types drop down menu to toggle to another cost type. Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how our resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so you may analyze the differences. You can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. See Cost Type Settings to configure custom cost types. Here are some example use cases that may apply. Committed Hours would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed task schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type. Timesheet Hours cost type would be the time spent on this plan. You could import the timesheet hours into this resource plan cost type. NOTE: Resources must be assigned a role to import their timesheet hours into the resource plan. " },

"body" : "Let’s begin by breaking down the statement “Sofia GPT is an advanced Azure OpenAI GPT module developed by OnePlan.” Azure  is a cloud computing platform operated by Microsoft that provides access, management, and development of applications and services via globally distributed data centers. OpenAI  is an AI research group responsible for the creation of the popular AI models GPT (language-based generative AI), and DALL-E (image-based generative AI). GPT is short for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer.” “Generative” means that the AI model can create new data based on patterns that it has learned from its training data. “Pre-trained” means that the model has already been optimized based on this source data, meaning that it does not need to check back against its original training data every time it is prompted. So, it is a lot faster and more powerful than older AI models. And “Transformer” is a powerful type of neural network algorithm specialized in learning relationships between long strings of data, like sentences and paragraphs. In simpler terms, the GPT models are very good pattern identifiers and replicators. The GPT model AIs have been trained on huge quantities of human language. The AIs then learn common patterns between words in those datasets, and in doing so, become very good at reproducing human language. So, OnePlan developed Sofia GPT as a customized chatbot app that utilizes OpenAI’s GPT AI model. All of this is then hosted in Azure (Microsoft) data centers and integrates seamlessly with OnePlan technology. The Sofia GPT module is particularly useful for OnePlan users because it can leverage data not only from OpenAI’s network of data sources but from OnePlan itself. This makes Sofia GPT much different from other AI helpers found in PPM tools. Typically, the AI helpers are not able to access the data in the PPM tool, and so the analysis the AI is able to provide is limited to external data sources. Sofia GPT, however, can analyze data right from your OnePlan environment and provide a customized analysis that is relevant to you, your team, and your business. " },

Once you select the data source, interacting with Sofia is easy. Simply type in your question or a prompt, and let Sofia GPT work its magic! For example, if you were in the My Portfolio view, you could select  Analyze Data On This Page , then ask Sofia GPT \"Which plans should I start on next?\" Then Sofia GPT will analyze the plan data that is available in the My Portfolio view, and produce a response for you. Sofia GPT's responses are contextual to your OnePlan environment, and designed to be easy to use. Sofia GPT dynamically links plan and task names across all supported areas, enabling quick navigation and streamlined workflows. Further, responses containing table data are automatically formatted into a structured table, making it easier to interpret and analyze information at a glance. If you are unsure what you want to ask Sofia GPT, some example questions will be available when you open the chat window to get you started. Just click on an example question, and Sofia GPT will generate a response. If you developed a prompt that you really like and want to reuse, you can pin that prompt for later use. Users with appropriate permissions can save globally for team-wide use, while others save personally, ensuring tailored access for all. This feature helps prioritize the most critical questions for efficient decision-making. To reset your conversation with Sofia GPT, click the Reset conversation context button  . This will clear out all previous chat data and allow you to restart a fresh conversation with Sofia GPT. To expand the chat window, click the Expand button  . This will expand the chat window.

"body" : "[video] The first thing you’ll see in the upper right-hand corner is that you can have snapshots of these status reports. From this drop-down, you can access all of your current and historical status reports. In this example, the status report for 1\/25\/2024 is Pending and needs to be reviewed, updated, and submitted. Basically what OnePlan does is it generates a status report based on the current data in your plan. What’s nice about this is that you can come into your pending status report and make modifications before submitting it. Any changes that you make in the status report will also be reflected in the plan itself, so your data is accurate across the board. You can edit any editable field in the status report. So, for this example, I may need to update the Status Health of my plan before I submit this report. I can simply click into the Status Health field, and select the correct value. This updated Status Health value will also be reflected in the live plan as well. Perhaps I need to update the Forecast value in this status report. I can click into the Forecast field and update this value. Again, this value will also be updated in the plan itself. Finally, maybe I would like to add some Additional Comments into the status report, I can enter those comments into the Additional Comments field, and those comments will be tracked as your plan progresses and future status reports are generated. I can even use Sofia to generate content for these multi-line text fields! Check out this short video for an example of using SofiaGPT to help update a status report. " },

You can configure multiple Dashboards per Plan. Each Dashboard gets a tab. There is no limit to the number of Dashboard tabs you can create. For this article, we will walk through an example of configuring a Portfolio-level Dashboard together. To configure this Dashboard: Navigate to the Plan or Area where you want to configure the Dashboard. For this example, I want to configure the Dashboard for the My Portfolio Area. Go to the Dashboard tab of the Area. Select New > Dashboard . The Add Tab form will open. Complete the Add Tab form. Name : Enter a name for your Dashboard tab. For this example, I will call this tab \"Portfolio Summary\". Tab Type : Select the type of dashboard you want to create. Options include Dashboard (native OnePlan reports), and Power BI (where you can embed Power BI reports). For this example, I will select Dashboard . See Set Up Power BI Reporting Dashboards in OnePlan for instructions on how to setup an embedded Power BI reporting dashboard in OnePlan. Personal : Check the Personal check box to make the Dashboard only available to yourself. If left unchecked, the Dashboard will be global and available for all users who can access the Plan. For this example, I will leave the check box unchecked. This option is only available to users with Owner permissions. Users with lesser permissions can only create personal Dashboards. Slicers : Select fields to use as slicers for the Dashboard. Slicers are tools used to filter data in a report. They appear directly on the report page and help focus on specific information, updating the other visuals in the report to match the selected data. In this example, I will select the Goals , Business Unit , Category , and State fields to use as slicers. Click Next . Add filters to define the data that will be included in the Dashboard's reports. You can create filters based on any Plan-level field to define which plan data will be included in the Dashboard to create visualizations. For this example, I will create a filter that will bring in Plans where the Plan Type equals Project , Epic , or Engagement . Click Save . Your new Dashboard tab is complete and ready to be populated with report Widgets. " },
